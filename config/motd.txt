<h3>Picking admins based on timezones now. Not getting picked doesn't mean I hate you, you just happen to be in a timezone for which I already have admins</h3>
<h3>Please keep sending me mails (mail in OP) containing your byond name, timezone and when you play if you're interested in adminning</h3>
<h2>I've decided to make the guidelines for admins public: http://crunchepillar.x10host.com/nelly.htm (you should read this if you're a new admin)</h2>
<h3>Please keep in mind that our new admins are new to adminning in general. If you have any complaints about badmins don't just shitpost in the thread, please send me a mail</h3>
<h2>We are reaching the maximum of what my server can handle in terms of playernumbers. If you happen to have a dedicated server with great power-per-core and feel like taking over hosting please send me a mail</h2>
