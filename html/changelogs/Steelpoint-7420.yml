changes: 
  - rscadd: SS13's Head of Security has received a new attempted 1:1 recreation of a Old Earth weapon, the Captain's Antique Laser Gun.
  - rscadd: This gun features three firing modes, Tase, Laser and Breach. However this gun lacks the capability to recharge in the field, and is extreamly expensive.
  - rscadd: The gun's Breach setting fires a low powered Pulse round, it consumes a large amount of power, has a limited range of two tiles and deals the same damage as a laser does. However it is effective in destroying walls, hence the Breach title.
  - rscadd: INTERCEPTED TRANSMISSION REPORT: The Syndicate have expressed a interest in this new weapon, and have instructed field agents to do whatever they can to steal this weapon.
